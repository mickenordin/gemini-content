gMNd has a config file in yaml format that you can supply on the command line with either of these options
  -f
  --file

This is the example config, supplied with the server
```
---
# Uncomment below line to allow automtic directory indexing
#allow_dir_list: true
# Below is default bas path for your content
base_path: /var/gemini/gemtext
# To allow connectiond from the outside, set listen address below
#listen_addr: '0.0.0.0'
# To set debug logging, uncomment below line
#logg_level: 'DEBUG'
# To enable cgi functionality, configure something like below
#cgi_registry:
#     /envtest.*: 
#      - /var/gemini/cgi-bin/envtest.sh
server_cert: /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
server_key: /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
```
If you uncomment the options it enables directory indexing, sets the listen address to 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces), the log level to DEBUG and registers the script ./cgi-bin/envtest.sh to serve content for any path that matches the regex /envtest.*.

Notice that snakeoil certs won't actually work, you should generate your own certificates. This is a guide that should work well for you:

A full list of options are here:
```
allow_dir_list = true/false, default false (global option for now!)
base_path = the server root where you serve content from, default ./content
cgi_registry = you can set different cgi scripts to server content for different paths, no default
listen_addr = the ip address to listen to, default 127.0.0.1
listen_port = the port to listen to, default 1965
logg_level  = any of "CRITICAL", "DEBUG", "ERROR", "INFO", "NOTSET", "WARNING", defult is INFO
server_cert = the path to the TLS cert, default ./certs/cert.pem
server_key = the path to the TLS key, default ./certs/cert.key
```
