 You can build and run it from the supplied Dockerfile if you so whish:
```
docker build -t gmnd:latest .
```
By just running it, it will create self signed certs and serve example content from this repo:
```
docker run -p 1965:1965 gmnd
```
A slightly more interesting thing it can do is serve your own content, in this example from /tmp/content and dynamic content from /tmp/cgi-bin on your host machine:
```
docker run --mount type=bind,source="/tmp/content,target=/app/content" --mount type=bind,source="/tmp/ccgi-bin,target=/app/cgi-bin"-p 1965:1965 gmnd
```
Or even supply your own certificates from the outside, in this example in /usr/local/certs with static content from /tmp/content:
```
docker run --mount type=bind,source="/tmp/content,target=/app/content" --mount type=bind,source="/usr/local/certs,target=/app/certs" -p 1965:1965 gmnd
```
